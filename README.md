Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, this repo will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

and constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility ups the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility ups the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and miscellaneous changes ups the patch
